Professional, clean logo for "KD's Pressure Washing & Services".
- **Primary Text:** Bold, modern "KD'S" in vibrant blue (#0087ff).
- **Design:** A circular emblem containing an abstract mosaic or tile pattern. The mosaic should subtly incorporate shapes resembling water droplets and paint strokes.
- **Unity Element (Subtle):** Within the mosaic, use a gentle, flowing gradient of warm earth tones (terracotta, beige, brown) to represent community diversity. This should be an abstract texture, not literal people.
- **Accent Color:** Orange (#f97316) used for small highlight elements within the mosaic.
- **Overall Feel:** Corporate, clean, trustworthy, with a hint of warmth. Vector style.
""",

    "geometric_weave": """
Modern, premium logo for "KD's Pressure Washing & Services".
- **Primary Text:** "KD'S" in a strong, professional sans-serif font, colored vibrant blue (#0087ff). "Pressure Washing & Services" in smaller text below.
- **Design:** A stylized shield or badge shape. Inside, a clean, geometric pattern of interlocking lines or a subtle woven texture. The pattern should evoke a sense of strength and connection.
- **Unity Element (Subtle):** The interlocking lines of the weave can contain very subtle, alternating earth tones (beige, tan, brown) to imply different threads coming together as one.
- **Accent Color:** Orange (#f97316) used as a border or a single highlight line in the weave.
- **Black-Owned Pride (Subtle):** A single, small, clean star element in a tasteful gold/orange, integrated into the top of the shield.
- **Overall Feel:** Established, reliable, high-quality. Vector style, high contrast.
""",

    "dynamic_flow": """
Sleek, dynamic logo for "KD's Pressure Washing & Services".
- **Primary Text:** Stylized, slightly italicized "KD'S" in vibrant blue (#0087ff).
- **Design:** An abstract, circular swirl combining a blue wave/spray element with an orange (#f97316) paint stroke. The two elements should flow together harmoniously.
- **Unity Element (Subtle):** The blue wave can have a subtle gradient that shifts through a spectrum of blues, while the orange stroke has a gradient of warm earth tones, suggesting a blend of elements and community.
- **Florida Element (Subtle):** The overall circular shape can subtly evoke a sun.
- **Overall Feel:** Energetic, modern, transformative. Clean lines, vector style.
""",

    "minimalist_emblem": """
Clean, minimalist, and professional logo for "KD's Pressure Washing & Services".
- **Primary Text:** "KD'S" in a clean, bold font, central to the design. Blue (#0087ff).
- **Design:** A simple house or building outline, with a water droplet on one side and a paint roller stroke on the other, creating a balanced emblem.
- **Unity Element (Subtle):** The foundation line of the house graphic can be a thicker bar composed of a subtle, elegant gradient of warm earth tones (beige, tan, brown), symbolizing a strong community foundation.
- **Accent Color:** The paint stroke is orange (#f97316).
- **Overall Feel:** Approachable, professional, clear, and direct. High contrast, works well at small sizes.
