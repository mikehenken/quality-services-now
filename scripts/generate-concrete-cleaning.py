Natural candid smartphone photo of a Black woman actively power washing a concrete driveway in Florida, shot from medium distance showing both worker and driveway. Worker in slightly damp work clothes and t-shirt, hair tied back, sweaty from outdoor work, focused on pressure washing not looking at camera, holding professional pressure washer wand with visible water spray. Driveway is HALF CLEANED - left side still dirty with dark stains and grime, right side already cleaned showing light gray concrete, clear dramatic contrast between dirty and clean halves. Single-story house in background, palm trees, bright sunny day. Worker showing signs of real work - perspiration visible, clothes damp from water spray. Authentic work in progress photo, smartphone camera quality, natural outdoor lighting. Real person doing real work, dramatic before/after visible in same shot.
