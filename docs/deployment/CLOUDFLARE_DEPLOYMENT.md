# Cloudflare Pages Deployment Guide

## ðŸš€ One-Click Deployment to Cloudflare Pages (FREE)

This guide will help you deploy KD's Pressure Washing & Services website to Cloudflare Pages for **FREE** with automatic deployments on every git push.

---

## Prerequisites

- A GitHub account (free)
- A Cloudflare account (free) - [Sign up here](https://dash.cloudflare.com/sign-up)

---

## Step 1: Push to GitHub

### Option A: Using GitHub CLI (Recommended)

If you have GitHub CLI installed:

```bash
gh repo create kds-pressure-washing --public --source=. --remote=origin --push
```

### Option B: Using GitHub Website

1. Go to [GitHub](https://github.com/new)
2. Create a new repository named `kds-pressure-washing`
3. **Do NOT** initialize with README (we already have one)
4. Click "Create repository"
5. Run these commands in your terminal:

```bash
cd /home/mikeh/Projects/roe
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/kds-pressure-washing.git
git push -u origin main
```

Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your actual GitHub username.

## Step 2: Deploy to Cloudflare Pages

### ðŸŽ¯ The "One-Click" Process

1. **Go to Cloudflare Pages**
   - Visit [Cloudflare Pages Dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/pages)
   - Click **"Create a project"**

2. **Connect GitHub**
   - Click **"Connect to Git"**
   - Authorize Cloudflare to access your GitHub account
   - Select the `kds-pressure-washing` repository

3. **Configure Build Settings**
   
   Fill in these EXACT settings:
   
   | Setting | Value |
   |---------|-------|
   | **Project name** | `kds-pressure-washing` (or your choice) |
   | **Production branch** | `main` |
   | **Framework preset** | `Next.js (Static HTML Export)` |
   | **Build command** | `npm run build` |
   | **Build output directory** | `out` |
   | **Root directory** | `/` (leave empty) |
   | **Environment variables** | None needed |

4. **Deploy!**
   - Click **"Save and Deploy"**
   - Wait 2-3 minutes for the build to complete â˜•
   - Your site will be live at `https://kds-pressure-washing.pages.dev`

---

## Step 3: Your Free Cloudflare Subdomain! ðŸŽ‰

**You're done!** Cloudflare automatically gives you a FREE subdomain:

- **Your live URL:** `https://kds-pressure-washing.pages.dev`
- **FREE SSL certificate** included
- **Works immediately** - no setup needed
- **No domain purchase required**

This is a **real, permanent URL** you can use forever at no cost!

---

## Optional: Add Your Own Custom Domain Later

**Only if you want to use your own domain** (like `kdspressurewashing.com`):

1. In Cloudflare Pages dashboard, click on your project
2. Go to **"Custom domains"** tab
3. Click **"Set up a custom domain"**
4. Enter your domain name
5. Follow the DNS configuration instructions
6. Wait for SSL certificate (usually takes 5-10 minutes)

**Note:** You'll need to own the domain and manage its DNS through Cloudflare. **This is completely optional** - the free `.pages.dev` subdomain works great!

---
