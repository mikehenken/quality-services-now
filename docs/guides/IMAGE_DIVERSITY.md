## Notes for Future Images

When generating new service images:

1. **Vary ethnicity/race** - Don't default to one group
2. **Include women** - Especially in non-traditional roles
3. **Make it candid** - Side angles, workers focused on task
4. **Show real work** - Dirt, sweat, messy clothes are good
5. **Avoid shine** - No perfect studio lighting
6. **Natural angles** - Not posed, not looking at camera
